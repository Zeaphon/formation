#Current State of Climate Patch#
Our group has been evolving quickly. This summary is intended to help get new comers up to speed and to show the world what we've accomplished so far.

##Summary##
* Formed on 11/11/2016 by a group of redditors at [/r/climatepatch/](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatepatch/)
* Climate Patch has evolved into a platform where talented people gather, brainstorm, and start projects to develop products that will help solve the climate crisis.
* For two of our favorite ideas, leads have been chosen and are forming their teams to begin development.
* Designers are in the process of establishing the Climate Patch image and web presence.
* We are still, and always will be, discussing new ideas and looking for volunteers that have the skills to make them a reality.
