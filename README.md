##Project Phases
[Phase 1: Formation](Phase1.md): Who, What, When, Why, How
* We are here.
* Determine what is the simplest thing we can build to start having a positive impact.
* Brand our idea. Give it a name.
* Organize to begin work.


Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product
* See brainstorming section below.


Phase 3: Growth
* Scale our community as fast as possible. Establish a web presence.


##Our Cause
Strength in numbers. Create a place where people can come together to create change.


How can we help reduce our impact on climate change?
* Reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
* Reduce consumption of products that are produced in a way that has a high negative environmental impact.
* Support politicians, companies, and researchers that recognize and actively participate in reducing our impact on climate change.


##Problems to Solve##
1. Spread awareness of climate change.
2. People feel powerless to help and have not been given an easy way to prevent climate change.
3. People are not aware the impact they have on climate change.

##Proposed Solutions##
1. [Politician, company, and researcher climate impact score](Solutions/CompanyClientImpactScore.md)
2. [Automated end user carbon footprint calculation](Solutions/CarbonFootprintCalculator.md)
3. [List of resources (books/video/web journals/etc) to get educated](Solutions/ListOfResources.md)
4. [Positive impact challenges](Solutions/PositiveImpactChallenges.md)
