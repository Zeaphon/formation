##Project Phases
[Phase 1: Formation](Phase1.md): Who, What, When, Why, How
* We are here.
* Determine what is the simplest thing we can build to start having a positive impact.
* Brand our idea. Give it a name.
* Organize to begin work.


Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product
* See brainstorming section below.


Phase 3: Growth
* Scale our community as fast as possible. Establish a web presence.


##Our Cause
Strength in numbers. Create a place where people can come together to create change.


How can we help reduce our impact on climate change?
* Reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
* Reduce consumption of products that are produced in a way that has a high negative environmental impact.
* Support politicians, companies, and researchers that recognize and actively participate in reducing our impact on climate change.




##Brainstorming
What can we collectively do to support our cause? Throwing ideas at the wall to see what sticks:


###Politician, Company, and Researcher Impact Score Database
Collect data on politicians, companies, and researchers. Identify their impact on climate change. Use that data to direct consumers away from parties that have a high negative impact and toward parties that have a high positive impact.

###Monitor home power consumption and show to user
Send amount of electricity consumption recorded from power sockets and show statistics (living room consumption, bedroom consumption, socket 1, socket2, ...). User can see which device waste a lot of energy in one view.

###List of resources (books/video/web journals/etc) to get educated
Curate a list of high quality content that can help people truly understand the problem we face. In doing so, we will also learn which information is "sticky", and what needs to be presented in a clearer fashion.

**Example Use Case 1:** Use data collected to help a consumer easily find their local eco friendly grocery store.

* We have in our database information on three grocery store companies:
  * Company A has a high negative impact score because they freight in all of their produce from the other side of the world instead of sourcing local produce.
  * Company B has a neutral impact rating because they balance their carbon production by powering all of their stored by solar power.
  * Company C has a positive impact rating because they use solar power, only sell local, and do not sell plastic water bottles.
* With this information we allow the community to search for the closest grocery stores that has a positive impact rating.
* If none are found in the area, the user is provided a way to request or show interest in shopping at a grocery store like this. Data is collected and can be used to attract positive impact grocery stores in the users community.
