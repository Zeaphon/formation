# Assess Environmental Impact of Consumer Products


Note: Similar to [Carbon Footprint Calculator](CarbonFootprintCalculator.md) Idea


Have a sort of app/website/etc that is linked to a database with product's environmental information. 
A user can simply scan the barcode of any product the want to purchase, and the app will display -

1. Any environmental certifications of the company that sold the product (e.g. [Rainforest alliance](http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/faqs/what-does-rainforest-alliance-certified-mean) )
2. The 'calculated' environmental impact of the product (carbon footprint, etc)
3. Any alternative & more environmentally friendly products of the same type.
4. Information about/breakdown of proudction processes (e.g. uses a lot of crude oil, etc etc), and maybe some info/trivia of why this is bad for the environment. (e.g. oil industry causes these effects on people [or something])

## Challenges:
It would require a lot of data - and it would be very difficult to assess, collate and aggregate all the data.

Numbers 1 & 2 may be easily implemented if there were available APIs or websites we can scrape for data.

## Competition

None known

## Use Cases

A consumer wants to buy some food from the supermarket, they scan the barcode to determine the environmental footprint of the product- The application can then :

1. Suggest alternative products (& its price) and/or
2. Show where the person can purchase said alternative products

## Possible Impact (on firms)

If this gains enough traction - there might be less consumer demand for firms that use un-environmentally friendly production processes - forcing them to innovate / improve their processes.

Furthermore, there might be an increasing need for firms to have environmental audits to certify their products.
