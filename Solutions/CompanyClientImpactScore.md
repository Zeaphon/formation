###Use data collected to help a consumer easily find their local eco friendly grocery store

* We have in our database information on three grocery store companies:
  * Company A has a high negative impact score because they freight in all of their produce from the other side of the world instead of sourcing local produce.
  * Company B has a neutral impact rating because they balance their carbon production by powering all of their stored by solar power.
  * Company C has a positive impact rating because they use solar power, only sell local, and do not sell plastic water bottles.
* With this information we allow the community to search for the closest grocery stores that has a positive impact rating.
* If none are found in the area, the user is provided a way to request or show interest in shopping at a grocery store like this. Data is collected and can be used to attract positive impact grocery stores in the users community.
