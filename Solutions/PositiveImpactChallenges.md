#Positive Impact Challenges
The biggest problem people face, is that they have the feeling that they can't change anything about it.
What I would suggest, is to create a website where people can participate to small challenges, like going vegetarian for 1 week, or go to work by bike, or other small stuff like that. It's things that people can do, that will have great results when a lot of people commit to it.

Examples of challenges would be:
* go vegetarian for a week
* go by bike to work/school
* buy only local stuff
* try to reduce your waste for a week

We could make it something social, by making people share ideas and pictures of them doing these challenges. This would further motivate new people to join, since they see all kinds of people help.
You could start new challenges, and send them to people by mail, to make them come back. Go for extra hard challenges, etc.
I would make a social platform where people can work together on challenges, so they get the feeling that they're making a change to the world.
