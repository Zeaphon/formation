#Automated end user carbon footprint calculation

##Competition
None known.

##Use Cases
###Monitor home power consumption and show to user
Send amount of electricity consumption recorded from power sockets and show statistics (living room consumption, bedroom consumption, socket 1, socket2, ...). User can see which device waste a lot of energy in one view.

###Monitor consumer product footprints and show to user
Similar to monitoring home consumption, users can be notified of the environmental footprints of the products they purchase. Alternatives may be shown to help promote better decisions. This could extend to beyond purchasing products. For example, how many times do I need to use an eco-bag to make it better than using plastic?
